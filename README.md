# 🔥🛠️ Foundry Storage Upgrade Seatbelt

- Protect your Smart Contract Proxy from storage collisions upon upgrading, by running this action in a CI on each of your Pull Requests!

## How it works

Everytime somebody opens a Pull Request, the action runs [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) `forge` to generate the storage layout of the Smart Contract you want to check.

Once generated, the action will fetch the comparative storage layout stored as an artifact from previous runs; parse & compare them, pinning warnings and errors on the Pull Request.

## Getting started

### Automatically generate & compare to the previous storage layout on every PR

Add a workflow (`.github/workflows/foundry-storage-check.yml`):

```yaml
name: Check storage layout

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    # Optionally configure to run only for changes in specific files. For example:
    # paths:
    # - src/**
    # - test/**
    # - foundry.toml
    # - remappings.txt
    # - .github/workflows/foundry-storage-check.yml

jobs:
  check_storage_layout:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive

      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: onbjerg/foundry-toolchain@v1
        with:
          version: nightly

      - name: Check storage layout
        uses: Rubilmax/foundry-storage-check@v1.0
```

> :information_source: **An error will appear at first run!**<br/>
> 🔴 <em>**Error:** No workflow run found with an artifact named "..."</em><br/>
> As the action is expecting a comparative file stored on the base branch and cannot find it (because the action never ran on the target branch and thus has never uploaded any storage layout)

## Options

### `contract` _{string}_

The path and name of the contract of which to inspect storage layout (e.g. src/Contract.sol:Contract).

_Required_

### `base` _{string}_

The gas diff reference branch name, used to fetch the previous gas report to compare the freshly generated gas report to.

_Defaults to: `${{ github.base_ref || github.ref_name }}`_

### `head` _{string}_

The gas diff target branch name, used to upload the freshly generated gas report.

_Defaults to: `${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}`_

### `token` _{string}_

The github token allowing the action to upload and download gas reports generated by foundry. You should not need to customize this, as the action already has access to the default Github Action token.

_Defaults to: `${{ github.token }}`_

This repository is maintained independently from [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and may not work as expected with all versions of `forge`.
